## ✨ Key Features

- **🛡️ Security-First Design**: Pre-configured security settings aligned with healthcare compliance requirements
- **🧩 Modular Architecture**: Mix and match components for flexible infrastructure deployment
- **📚 Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guidance and examples for each module
- **🔄 Continuous Updates**: Regular security patches and compliance enhancements
- **⚡ Rapid Deployment**: Deploy compliant infrastructure in minutes, not weeks

## 📦 Available Modules

## 🚀 Quick Start

Each module includes step-by-step documentation in its respective folder. Here's a simple example of setting up a FHIR repository:

```terraform
module "healthlake" {
  source = "github.com/momentum-ai/healthstack.git//aws-healthlake/module"

  datastore_name    = "fhir-datastore"
  kms_admin_iam_arn = var.my_admin_user
  preload_data      = false
  create_kms_key    = true
  data_bucket_name  = "fhir-data-bucket"
  logs_bucket_name  = "fhir-logs-bucket"
}
```

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

- **HIPAA Alignment**: Modules designed with HIPAA Technical Safeguards in mind
- **Encryption Everywhere**: All data encrypted at rest and in transit by default
- **Least Privilege Access**: Fine-grained IAM policies limiting access to protected health information
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging for all infrastructure activities
- **Regular Security Scans**: Modules continuously tested against security benchmarks

## 🛠️ Development Status

We actively maintain and enhance these modules based on emerging security standards and AWS best practices. Current focus areas:

- Adding SOC2 compliance validation tools
- Adding more modules
- Expanding support for healthcare-specific workloads
- Implementing automated security scanning pipelines
